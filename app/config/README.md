# Venue App Navigation Structure explained

This page will include a detailed explanation of the route composition
chosen for the VenueApp.

## Navigators within navigators?

Specifically, I will explain the navigators within navigators, what that structure
achieves and why it was chosen.

## Map screen in separate navigator?

I will also explain why the map screen gets placed in a separate navigator,
how this helps with custom screen transition animations and what alternatives
exist.
